                <h2>18 Card Game Rules</h2>
                <p>Welcome to 18, a strategic card game where you compete against the computer!</p>
                
                <h3>Game Setup</h3>
                <p>Both players start with two sets of cards numbered 1 through 9 (total of 18 cards each).</p>
                
                <h3>Gameplay</h3>
                <p>The game consists of 9 rounds. Each round has 2 phases:</p>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Phase 1:</strong> Both players secretly select a card to play. The cards are then revealed.</li>
                    <li><strong>Phase 2:</strong> Both players secretly select another card to play (can be any remaining card). The cards are revealed.</li>
                </ol>
                
                <h3>Winning a Round</h3>
                <p>After both phases, the player with the higher sum of their two played cards wins the round.</p>
                <p>If the sums are equal, the round is a tie and no one gets a point.</p>
                
                <h3>Winning the Game</h3>
                <p>The first player to win 5 rounds wins the game. If no one reaches 5 wins after 9 rounds, the game is a tie.</p>
                
                <h3>Strategy Tips</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Pay attention to which cards have been played</li>
                    <li>After Phase 1 is revealed, decide whether to chase with a higher card or conserve your high cards</li>
                    <li>Try to predict what cards your opponent might play based on their previous moves</li>
                </ul>
